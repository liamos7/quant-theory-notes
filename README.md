## Overview

This repository contains a set of self-written notes with coded models on the mathematical foundations of modern quantitative finance. The material is intended to bridge rigorous probability theory and stochastic calculus with practical asset pricing, calibration, and model risk considerations.

The notes are **not a textbook** and are **not tied to a specific course**. Instead, they are designed as a structured reference that reflects how quantitative finance is theorized: models are derived from first principles, calibrated to market data, implemented numerically, and evaluated critically with respect to their limitations.

## Motivation

These notes were written to consolidate understanding of quantitative finance theory at a level suitable for quantitative research or graduate-level study of financial mathematics. Specifically, I wanted to make sure I had a solid understanding of theory, and believe that the best way to do that is to consolidate some central reference, with coded examples. Hopefully, these can also be of use to others.

## Scope and Topics

The notes cover the following core areas:

* Probability theory and measure-theoretic foundations
* Conditional expectation, filtrations, and martingales
* Brownian motion and stochastic calculus
* Arbitrage pricing and change of measure
* Equity derivatives and exotic options
* Local and stochastic volatility models
* Term structure and interest rate modeling
* Credit risk and counterparty risk (XVA)
* Portfolio theory and optimal execution
* Time series models and volatility estimation
* Numerical methods and Monte Carlo simulation
* Model risk, calibration instability, and practical pitfalls

Each major topic includes explicit examples designed to connect abstract theory to concrete pricing and modeling tasks.

## How to Read These Notes

* Readers interested in **theoretical foundations** may focus on Chapters 1–3.
* Readers interested in **derivative pricing and modeling** may focus on Chapters 3–6.
* Readers interested in **practical limitations** should read the final chapter on model risk and calibration.

The document is written to be largely self-contained, though familiarity with undergraduate probability and calculus is assumed.

## Examples and Implementation

Where appropriate, analytical examples are included directly in the notes. Selected models are also implemented numerically in accompanying notebooks (if present), illustrating:

* Monte Carlo pricing
* Implied volatility and surface calibration
* Stochastic volatility simulation
* Numerical stability and discretization effects

These implementations are intended to demonstrate methodology rather than production-level systems.
