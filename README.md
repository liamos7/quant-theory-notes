risk management, and trading strategies. Combines mathematical theory with 
practical implementations in Python.

## Theoretical Foundation

I've compiled [comprehensive notes](notes/quantitative_finance_notes.pdf) 
covering the mathematical foundations of quantitative finance:

- Stochastic calculus and martingale theory
- Derivatives pricing (Black-Scholes, exotic options)
- Interest rate and credit models
- Portfolio optimization and risk management
- Numerical methods (Monte Carlo, finite difference)
- Machine learning applications

These notes synthesize material from Shreve, Bjork, and academic papers.

## Projects

### 1. [Volatility Surface Modeling](projects/01_volatility_surface/)
**Objective:** Model implied volatility dynamics using local and stochastic 
volatility frameworks.

**Key Techniques:**
- Implied volatility surface extraction from SPY options
- SVI/SSVI parametrization with arbitrage detection
- Dupire local volatility implementation
- Heston stochastic volatility calibration (Carr-Madan FFT and Lewis methods)
- Volatility risk premium estimation

**Results:** Identified and corrected arbitrage violations in raw SVI, 
calibrated Heston, estimated vol risk premium.

**Tech Stack:** Python, NumPy, SciPy, Plotly, yfinance

### 2. [Variance Swap Pricing](projects/02_variance_swaps/) *(Coming Soon)*
Replication-based pricing using log contracts and comparison to stochastic 
volatility models.

### 3. [Options Greeks and Dynamic Hedging](projects/03_greeks_hedging/) *(Coming Soon)*
Simulation of delta-gamma hedging with transaction costs and comparison to 
theoretical costs.

### 4. [Strategy Backtesting Framework](projects/04_strategy_backtest/) *(Coming Soon)*
Historical analysis of covered calls, iron condors, and volatility arbitrage 
strategies.

## Background

I'm a Princeton physics senior with research experience in high-energy 
experimental physics at CERN, focusing on machine learning applications for 
particle detection and classification. I became interested in quantitative 
finance while exploring applications of stochastic processes and statistical 
methods to financial markets.

These projects represent my self-directed learning in mathematical finance, 
combining rigorous theory with practical implementation.
